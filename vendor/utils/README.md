# Smartface Helper JS Libraries / Utils

## What is it?

Smartface supports most of the JS libraries out there which doesn't use DOM by design.
In general we're putting main vendors' libraries under their seperate folders. For individual developers' libraries we've created `/vendors/utils` to keep them together.

All files have their own comments for "what is this file for", "where is the originating repo" etc. 

## How to use?

You can just include any file by adding simply `include("libs/vendor/utils/lib.name.js")`
